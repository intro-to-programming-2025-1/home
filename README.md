# 🧠 Introduction to Programming

Welcome to the **Introduction to Programming** course! In just 8 weeks, you’ll learn to build full-stack web applications using modern tools. We start with Git, JavaScript, and React on the frontend, then dive into backend development using **FastAPI** – a high-performance Python web framework – and finish with database integration and authentication.
